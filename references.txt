  Esential Software:
    -Anaconda(used for setting up virtual environments): https://www.anaconda.com
    -Git(version controll):https://git-scm.com
    -An IDE (Options listed below)

recommended IDEs for python developement
  -vscode (recommended):https://code.visualstudio.com
    NOTE: vscode stands for visual studio code. It is not the same as Visual Studio
    NOTE:vscode is used to write many different languages and requires a small amount
    of configuration to get working for python development but there are a plethora of
    tutorials available for vs code so setup won't be too difficult
    Reccomended plugins for vscode:
      -bracket pair colorizer(highlights bracket pairs)
      -python(allows for error checking)
      -Code Spell(spell checker)
      -CodeSnap(great for sending code snipets)
      -Live Share(allows for a google docs like coding environment)
      -Tabnine(AI code completion)
      -Vim(emulates the vim editor in vscode. Not for the faint of heart)
      -GitHub(allows the user to access GitHub directly from the IDE)
      -GitLense(shows information about git status)
      -A sexy color theme(because colors)
  -pyCharm:https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
    NOTE: pycharm is a paid product but can be gotten for free through a student licnese    follow this link to aquire said license 
    https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students
  -Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com

  NOTE: I personally use Neo VIM as my primary editor but do not reccomend it
  for beginners
  it is fantastic for advanced users but without a solid understanding of Git, Unix,
  and the terminal it can be almost impossible to set up and use.
  that being said my config is available at: https://github.com/JasonBoyett/nvim-config
  and a ready made config is available here: https://www.lunarvim.org
